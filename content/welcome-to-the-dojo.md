# CoderDojo Luxembourg let the Coding begin

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read" target="_blank">tl;dr</a>:

CoderDojo Luxembourg is for 12 to 18 year old people who want to discover the wonderous world of coding.

<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/coderdojo-luxembourg-first-code-session-tickets-12579155593" target="_blank">Register here.</a>

We will meet every Thursday from 18:00 to 20:00 (or later for people who want to stay until their bus comes)

The first session will be on the 25th of September 2014 in Bonnevoie <a href="https://wiki.hackerspace.lu/wiki/Location" target="_blank">click here for a detailed map</a>.

CoderDojo will fill the void of enabling young people to move from plain consumers to creators of Information Technologies.

We will mainly focus our efforts on coding but are not shy to get our hands on the current hardware trends like the raspberry pi.

The Dojo is an open ended effort and ultimately every participant will create her own amazing project.

There will be no restrictions on prior knowledge for the participants. Bring your curiosity to discover the awesome and let us be awesome together.
