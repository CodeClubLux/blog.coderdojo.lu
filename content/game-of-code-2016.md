Summary: :yin_yang: CoderDojo Luxembourg had a team participating at the 2016 edition of the Game of Code

# Brief

Three 12-13 year old CoderDojo programmers reach the 4th place (out of 22 international competitors) in the #OpenData challenge at the first <a href="http://gameofcode.eu" target="_blank">Game of Code</a> event in Luxembourg.

# Details

On April 8th three CoderDojo Programmers took on the challenge to participate at the first ever Game of Code in Luxembourg City.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">Hackathon</a> was powered by <a href="http://doclerholding.com" target="_blank">Docler Holding</a> and <a href="http://itone.lu" target="_blank">IT One</a> and the challenges were designed by Docler Holding (artificial intelligence) as well as the Governmental <a href="http://www.digital-luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Lëtzebuerg</a> Initiative’s <a href="http://data.public.lu" target="_blank">OpenData</a> Portal.

Team CoderDojo Luxembourg consisted of **Daria**, **Henri** and **Linnea** and they chose the open-data challenge to develop a Mobile Application to help Dog owners find the Dog-waste disposal bags in and around the City of Luxembourg more easily.

During 24 hours, with a short 6 hour bed-time break, the Team came up with the <a href="http://Pick-a-Poop.dog" target="_blank">Pick-a-Poop.dog</a> Website.

Whilst the project is not 100% finished and many features will be added soon, the essence of the project has been understood and appreciated by the jury ranking them 4th in a pool of 22 international and mostly professional, developers.

This rank awarded them a special mention by the organizers plus a gift-card which motivated the team to participate in future Hackathons.

# Team

**Daria** is of Bulgarian origin and really enjoys the JavaScript programming language as well as design.

**Henri** is of Finnish origin and when he is not programming the Nao robot to support the <a href="https://pick-a-poop.dog" target="_blank">pick-a-poop.dog</a> project, he makes sure that the code gets fixed and solutions to technical challenges are found.

**Linnea** is of Swedish/Irish origin and is not afraid to speak in front of a large audience after having programmed an entire weekend HTML and adapted CSS templates.

# Full Disclosure

<a href="https://twitter.com/SteveClement" target="_blank">Steve Clement</a> who mentored the CoderDojo Team up to the even but not necessarily during the event, was also a judge in the Game of Code Hackathon. He decided, in accordance with the other judges, to retract his vote for Team CoderDojo to avoid any conflict of interest or unfair advantages in regards to the other participants.
