# Long Version

CoderDojo Luxembourg is a Code Club Luxembourg project driven by volunteers to teach coding and technologies to youngsters aged 9 to 18.

For the past year a steady group of 15-20 Kids has gathered in the heart of Luxembourg-City every Thursday no matter the weather.

**On** the 15th of December 2015 we will have a spontaneous Pop-up CoderDojo at the eSkills4Jobs conference from 12:30 to 14:00 in Dommeldange at the Parc Hotel Alvisse.

You can join us earlier to share a delicious lunch.

The exact address is:
```
120, Route d'Echternach
L-1453 Luxembourg
```


During this pop-up CoderDojo we will be programming small Radio Controlled devices to autonomously steer themselves through an obstacle course.

To register **send an email to** <a href="mailto:info@corderdojo.lu">info@coderdojo.lu</a>. We have only **limited** places.
